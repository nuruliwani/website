<P>EVERYONE'S FIRST SEMESTER AT UNIVERSITY IS DIFFERENT. MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN A MIX OF BOTH POSITIVE AND CHALLENGING TIME. THE TRANCISION FROM SCHOOL TO UNIVERSITY WAS A BIT DIFFICULT. GENERALLY, I'VE ENJOYABLE MOMENT. HOWEVER, LIKE MOST STUDENT, I HAD FIRST TIME NERVES AND MISSED HOME FAR MORE THAN I EXPECTED.</P>
<P>ON THE FIRST SEMESTER, I AM REALLY LUCKY, BECAUSE ONE OF MY ROOMMATE IS ACTUALLY SAME COURSE WITH ME. WE BECOME A GOOD FRIEND. WE ALWAYS STUDY AND DO ASSIGNMENT TOGETHER. WE SPENDING MOST OF TIME IN UNIVERSITY TOGETHER. EVEN THOUGH NOW WE ARE NOT A ROOMMATE, WE ARE STILL GOOD FRIEND UNTIL NOW.</P>
